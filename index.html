          <figcaption>When my youngest was in middle school she loved Dr. Who. I decided to make her this scarf. Double
            knitting is a technique where two "right-sides" are knit at the same time in opposite colors.Each row is
            knit twice, skipping every other stitch which belongs to the other side. It's tedious (particularly when
            done in laceweight yarn on tiny needles) and errors tend to be glaring. On both sides.
            <br>This thing is, still to this day when she's reached her adult height, longer than she is tall. She
            doesn't seem to wear it but to the best of my knowledge she still has it.

          <figcaption>This animal. I recently had someone say, "That is a dog, right?" to me in earnest. Meet Mavis, a
            Peruvian Hairless. I think she looks like a mix of a dog, a bat, and Dobby the house elf.
            <br>We've had her for 12 years now and she's been a really great dog. Weird as hell but great.

          <img href="web-projects/TheDeepEnd/images/noro-entrelac-mavis.png" alt="my dog and knitting">
          <figcaption>Clearly an animal like Mavis would be hard pressed to survive on her own. It's not like she can
            put on her own sweaters or tuck herself in under the blanket once she gets comfy with her head on a pillow.
            <br>She's excellent snuggle company while I'm knitting until her head needs to be on my yarn, or arms, or
            anything else that renders me unable to do anything but pet her.

          <img href="web-projects/TheDeepEnd/images/pipes-covid-hosp.png"
            alt="pipes ready to braze at covid field hospital">
          <figcaption>Beginning in March 2020 I worked 12 hour shifts, 7 nights a week installing the oxygen lines in
            the temporary Covid hospitals in my state. For a month I fit up and brazed copper pipes, went home to sleep,
            and then back the next night for more.
            <br>I didn't mind working the overnight shift because there were far fewer people in the building and a lot
            about Covid was still unknown. The pay differential didn't hurt either.

            alt="standing water inside a building under construction">
          <figcaption>Working in an inch of water in the middle of winter is one of the top reasons I strongly prefer
            steel frame construction. Even an incomplete roof will keep some of the water out. With wood it all comes in
            as there can be no roof at all until all the floors are built.
            <br>On this job they drilled holes in all of the upper floors and all of the water came down to where I was
            working. The idea was to pump it out. They didn't pump it out. This is when my work fashion became
            "construction worker meets Irish farmer". All of the layers on top to keep me warm and dry in below freezing
            temps with insulated Carhartt bibs rolled up to my knees over rainboots. Let me tell you - it's a look.
